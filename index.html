        <h1>Language Server Protocol</h1>
        <p>
            The Language Server protocol is used between a tool (the client) and a language smartness provider (the server) to integrate features like auto complete, goto definition, find all references and alike into the tool.

            <blockquote>
              <p>Supporting rich editing features like code auto-completions or "Go to Definition" for a programming language in an editor or IDE is traditionally very challenging and time consuming. Usually it requires writing a domain model (a scanner, a parser, a type checker, a builder and more) in the programming language of the editor or IDE. Things would be a lot easier if a development tool could reuse existing libraries. However, these libraries are usually implemented in the programming language itself (for example, good C/C++ domain models are implemented in C/C++). Integrating a C/C++ library into an editor written in TypeScript is technically possible but hard to do. Alternatively, we can run the library in its own process and use inter-process communication to talk to it. The messages sent back and forth form a protocol. The language server protocol (LSP) is the product of standardizing the messages exchanged between a development tool and a language server process.</p>

            <p>
                A language server runs in its own process and tools like VS Code communicate with the server using the language protocol over JSON-RPC.

            <p>
                There are three different kinds of LSP implementors: server providing editing features for programming language, tool integrations and LSP SDKs.

            <p>
                Version 3.0 of the protocol has been around for some time. Our current focus is to stabilize and clarify the specification.
